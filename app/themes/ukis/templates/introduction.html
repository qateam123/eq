<h2 class="neptune">Aim of this survey</h2>
<p>The aim of the UK Innovation Survey (UKIS) is to collect data from businesses about various aspects of their innovation related activities to enable measurement of the extent, types and trends in innovation.</p>
<p>The UKIS data provides a major source of evidence to inform government policy for promoting innovation activities among businesses to boost economic growth. The data collected also serves as an important contributor to the Community Innovation Survey conducted across Europe, which is used for international benchmarking and comparison purposes. We are interested in responses from both businesses conducting innovation and businesses not currently engaged in innovation as this can help to inform our wider understanding of the constraining factors.</p>
